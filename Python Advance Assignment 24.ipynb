    "\n",
    "Ans. Attaching a program counter to an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) interpreter application can offer several benefits. Here are some of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sequential Execution: A program counter helps ensure the sequential execution of instructions in the RPN script. \n",
    "It keeps track of the current instruction being executed, allowing the interpreter to process one line at a time in the correct order.\n",

    "*Error Handling: When encountering an error or an exceptional condition in the RPN script, the program counter enables effective error handling. \n",
    "It allows the interpreter to identify the line where the error occurred, making it easier to provide meaningful error messages or handle exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Jumping and Branching: A program counter facilitates the implementation of branching and jumping mechanisms within the RPN script. \n",
    "By storing the current instruction address, the interpreter can support conditional statements (such as if-else or while loops) and perform relative or absolute jumps to different sections of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Looping and Iteration: With a program counter, an RPN interpreter can implement loops and iterations effectively. \n",
    "By updating the program counter appropriately, the interpreter can repeat a block of code or iterate over a specific range of instructions, enabling repetitive operations without duplicating code."
